# Text Data Templates

This repo contains R scripts for cleaning and preparing text data for further analysis. I will also provide simple templates of some popular text analysis methods such as Word2Vec, topic modeling (structural topic modeling, or LDA).   

In general my text-data-cleaning process is as follows: 

1. remove emojis 
2. remove URLs 
3. remove language(s) that you don't use in the final analysis 
4. remove spams
